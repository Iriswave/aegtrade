            <p class="what-are-ppp-paragraph our-role-paragraph">
                We are uniquely qualified to assist you in self-funding developments and providing
                humanitarian relief without the use of debt. What you will find here will serve as an introduction to a Government
                Trade Platform and how the trade can assist you by generating trade proceeds to be utilized in funding
                your infrastructure project or funding much needed Humanitarian projects. Trade proceeds can be used to
                fund the most desperately needed projects with cash.
                <br><br>
                Private Placement Programs, also called “High Yield Investment Programs”, are private (non-public)
                investment programs which are based on the purchase or sale of bank financial instruments. In most cases
                SBLC’s and MTN’s are used. These instruments are bought fresh-cut with a high discount on their base
                value to later be resold at a higher price in the secondary market. The difference between the sale
                price and the purchase price is the investor’s profit. These programs are offered to investors with high
                spending capacity and can only be executed by qualified traders with a license to carry out these kinds
                of transactions.
                <br><br>A very special aspect of these programs is that usually the largest part of the returns
                is allocated to humanitarian causes as well as to the financing of larger business projects. So, any
                institution takes precedence on this type of operation. Actually, this type of program is not well known
                publicly, so only a very small group of investors that own significant funds or bank instruments have
                access to them. These programs have been issued for the past 60 years to finance humanitarian projects
                and international trade.
