                <h1>Government Trade Proceeds</h1>
                <p>
                    Projects of every imaginable size and scope can be funded with the proceeds of the Trade Platform.
                    This will allow for debt free project funding of even the largest government projects.
                </p>
                <h2>Highlights</h2>
                <p>
                    Proceeds from the trade Program are yours to use. This is not a loan; these created funds belong to
                    you. You can build needed infrastructure and construct or modernize Ports, Roadways, develop LNG
                    terminals and refineries, implement Agriculture improvements, and build schools and Hospitals. The
                    list of potential acceptable projects is vast.<br><br>
                    Every Fed Trade Program does require rigorous accounting of funds. Your intended use of these funds
                    will be pre-approved before being accepted to into the Platform and trading begins.<br><br>
                    Some of the world’s largest Bank Holding Companies are authorized to issue blocks of debt
                    instruments such as medium-term notes and standby letters of credit. Essentially Government Trade
                    Programs exist to 'create' money. Money is created by creating debt. However, this is not your debt,
                    this is one avenue for newly created Dollars and Euros to enter the banking system and you will be
                    the beneficiary of the new Cash generated through the Platform.
