                <h1>Historical Background</h1>
                <p>
                    The “United States Department of the Treasury” (US Treasury), fulfilling its responsibilities under
                    the Bretton Woods Agreements from the 1960’s, developed the financial instrument known as a
                    Medium-Term Note (MTN) by employing established European financing methods through which banks and
                    financial institutions commonly finance long-term loans by selling Letters of Credit or Bank Notes
                    of medium term to provide funding for loans. In the post-World War II era, the US Treasury and its
                    affiliates adopted the protocols of the finance syndicates led by major European bank holding
                    companies that would issue their Medium-Term Notes guaranteed by a matching US Treasury
                    Guarantee.<br><br>
                    The US Treasury and the “Federal Reserve System” (Federal Reserve) developed an instrument that may
                    be traded to create new credit and that credit would be used in specific approved macroeconomic
                    projects allowing such funds and credit to be applied in geographical areas requiring credit and
                    cash infusions to survive and grow. While that understanding or intent remains true today, it is no
                    longer always a necessary requirement for involvement in such initiatives. Credit is created when
                    the US Treasury, or its European equivalent the European Central Bank (ECB), can either make
                    available to, or de facto authorize, those Bank Instruments, at a discounted rate (Primary Market
                    Issue), to approved and pre-qualified Private Placement Depositors with qualifying funds on deposit,
                    known here as “Asset Providers”. Such contracts to purchase and sell these trading instruments are
                    managed and/or approved by the US Treasury which are administered by prime US and European bank
                    syndicates. The US Treasury or the Federal Reserve may price these instruments at whatever price is
                    necessary to provide the needed new credit in the geographical location or for the project(s) for
                    which they have been approved.<br><br>
                    Not all Applicants or Projects are approved. Both the Applicant and the funds that will be used to
                    purchase and sell the financial instruments must be screened according to US Patriot Act and
                    Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines and their European equivalents. The Asset Provider may be financing
                    more than their own projects but all of the projects must be submitted and subject to approval
                    (although most projects do not go through such a process.) When the earnings are generated, they are
                    deposited in a Bank Project Account. Generally, there is just one Principal (or Asset Provider).
                    That Principal is the owner of the Funds and the Principal is the Applicant to the “trade entity”,
                    which must also have the approval to trade from the US Treasury or the Federal Reserve.
                </p>
                <h2>The Investment Opportunity</h2>
                <p>
                    The entry qualification is a very low risk opportunity for an “investor” who can provide a cash
                    deposit, Bank Guarantee (BG) or a Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC) that allows for the credit value
                    for a minimum of Euro One Hundred Million (€100,000,000) for the Government level Trading Programs.
                    This Bank Instrument (BI) allows the receiving bank to provide credit facilities and once monetized
                    to a market cash value of the depository cash itself, under structured contract positions allows for
                    the trading commitments to engage. The returns to the investor (“Asset Provider”) are all subjective
                    based on market availability and program considerations, all of which are disclosed at the time of a
                    compliance cleared client engagement.

                <h2>How it Works</h2>
                <p>
                    Once a new money qualified Investor or Client exists the Private placement traders operate against
                    non-depleting, tradeable lines-of-credit or “blocked” cash accounts established on behalf of the
                    Asset Provider/investor. The Trader's lines-of-credit (regardless of whether BI’s or blocked cash is
                    provided) are derived from prime banks that offer credit facilities. These credit-issuing banks,
                    however, are governed by the current Basil II and Basel III and Basel IV Accords, which became
                    effective in September, 2006, January 2010 and January 2018, respectively, which impose strict
                    requirements on bank lending and borrowing. Most notably a bank’s credit lines must be "capitalized"
                    by an acceptable form of collateral (of sufficient value) held "in the care, custody and control" of
                    the credit issuing facility. The collateral is the BI itself. The controlling variable is whether or
                    not the trade group's procedures satisfy the credit-issuing bank's "care, custody and control"
                    standard for activating Credit Lines—the control test.<br><br>
                    AEG Trade has a well-established relationship with a several of prime banks that function in this
                    market of collateral monetization. Additionally, successful trade programs, besides having unique
                    access to established bank lines-of-credit, require the expertise of qualified traders capable of
                    engaging in the purchase and sale of investment-grade bank debentures in the wholesale market.
                    Traders are generally licensed by European regulatory agencies and trades proceed according to
                    strict procedural and legal guidelines. Under present rules, traders cannot use their own assets to
                    trade. This trading operation is generally referred to as a "controlled", "managed", “closed” bank
                    debenture trading effort because the Supply Side of the financial instruments and the Exit Buyer for
                    the financial instruments have already been pre-arranged and the price of the instruments already
                    established. Hence, each and every completed trade will result in a net gain (and never a net loss)
                    to the trader.
                </p>
                <h2>Reasons for Superior Returns</h2>
                <p>There are three variables that work together to generate the high yields that characterize a
                    Government Trade. The three variables are velocity, leverage and compounding. The speed with which
                    deals happen makes a massive difference to the overall annual return. The trading platform utilizes
                    all three concepts within a unique financial environment in a Top 25 bank to create an incredibly
                    powerful vehicle that can generate exceptional returns with no risk to the investment capital.</p>
                <h2>Structure of the Venture</h2>
                <p>There are Agreements to be executed that will provide that the Net Income will be shared on a basis
                    between the Asset Provider and AEG as the intake manager that will be reported on a bi-monthly basis
                    but the primary beneficiary will be the Asset Provider. The Agreements MOA will clearly define the
                    protocols that will guarantee non-depletion of the BI and 100% transparency. Trade Agreements will
                    also make sure that a designated percentage of funds are actively engaged in qualifying projects.
